Ways to contribute
==================

Instant MISO is a community-driven and open source project.
There are many ways to contribute to the InstantMISO project, it's as much about the code as it is the community. Here are some way to get involved regardless of your 
skill set:

-  **Be part of the community.** The best way to contribute to InstantMISO and help
   us grow is simply to use the auctions and promote the experience by
   word-of-mouth, blog posts, tutorials,
   videos, test contracts, support on the forums, Discord. You get the point.
   Being a user and advocate helps spread the word about InstantMISO,
   which has no marketing budget and relies on its community
   for adoption.



Testing and reporting issues
----------------------------

Another great way of contributing to the engine is to test development releases
or the development branch and to report issues. It is also helpful to report
issues discovered in stable releases, so that they can be fixed in
the development branch and in future maintenance releases.

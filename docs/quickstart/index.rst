This page provides a quick overview of InstantMISO. It assumes a level of familiarity with smart contract development, the Ethereum network and ERC20 tokens and will rely on some simple examples.

InstantMISO is a smart contract framework for creating Dutch auctions on Ethereum.

The idea of a Dutch auction is to determine a fair price for a batch of items. In particular, new projects and tokens with no previous price are perfect as they allow the market an even playing field for price discovery. Though there are many positives to using a Dutch auction for a fixed supply of any item, this document will cover the creation and auction of a brand new ERC20 token.  

.. note::
    To interact with InstantMISO, you'll first need to connect your Ethereum wallet. InstantMISO support many options for this, but we recommend `Metamask <https://metamask.io/>`_.



1 - Creating a New Token
========================


The first step to using MISO is having a token to launch.
.. note::
    If you already have some ERC20 tokens you wish to sell, continue to step 2.
 
 To mint your own new ERC20 token, you need to do the following:

- Enter your Tokenâ€™s name
- Add a symbol associated with your token
- Set a total supply

InstantMISO will mint the tokens for you and deposit them into your wallet. After creating your ERC20 tokens, you're ready to use the MISO Launcher
